# The ATHENA Project

> **A Technical Handbook of Essential Niche Advice**

The ATHENA Project is an online archive and technical handbook of essential niche advice I've put together. It contains a curated collection of specialized knowledge, tips, and tricks that I have compiled for personal reference and to share with others. The website is designed to be a go-to resource for quick reference on a range of niche topics, from technology to personal interests. Not every piece of information is original, but I've made sure to provide citations to give credit where credit is due.
