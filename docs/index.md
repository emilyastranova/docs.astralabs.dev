# Welcome to Tyler's Knowledge Base

A collection of useful tips, tricks, guides and things I've learned. This is a work in progress, so check back often for updates. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/tyleraharrison/docs.tylerharrison.dev).

I will also add documentation for projects that I have worked on, such as [my personal website](https://tylerharrison.dev), [hardware hacking](#categories) and [my home lab](#categories).
