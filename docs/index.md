> **A Technical Handbook of Essential Niche Advice**

Athena was the goddess of wisdom, courage, inspiration, mathematics, strategy, the arts, crafts, and skill

The ATHENA Project is an online archive and technical handbook of essential niche advice I've put together. It contains a curated collection of specialized knowledge, tips, and tricks that I have compiled for personal reference and to share with others. The website is designed to be a go-to resource for quick reference on a range of niche topics, from technology to personal interests. Not every piece of information is original, but I've made sure to provide citations to give credit where credit is due.

I will also add documentation for projects that I have worked on, such as [my personal website](https://astralabs.dev), [hardware hacking](#categories) and [my home lab](#categories).
